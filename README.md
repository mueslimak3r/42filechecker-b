# b_filechecker

Project testing program for 42 boost projects.

## Getting Started

I recommend cloning the filechecker to somewhere near where your projects are stored.

## Running the tests

To test your projects navigate to the root of b_filechecker's directory and run:

./run.sh [the test you want to run] [the path of your projects directory]

			[first param]					[second param]
			b_libft						../b_libft
			b_printf					/tmp/b_printf
			b_ls						etc...

Debugging options:
			
			cleanup		-removes log files-		../b_libft
			getnew		-forces an update-

### What the tests do

I evaluate:

The existence and proper formatting of your "author" file.

The basic functionality of your Makefile.

The functionality of your program compared to the functionality of the programs/functions they are imitating.
